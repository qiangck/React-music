XHR 的行为\n\t\t    3. 在发起请求时，自动检测是否需要拦截\n\t\t    4. 如果不必拦截，则执行原生 XHR 的行为\n\t\t    5. 如果需要拦截，则执行虚拟 XHR 的行为\n\t\t    6. 兼容 XMLHttpRequest 和 ActiveXObject\n\t\t        new window.XMLHttpRequest()\n\t\t        new window.ActiveXObject(\"Microsoft.XMLHTTP\")\n\t\n\t\t    关键方法的逻辑：\n\t\t    * new   此时尚无法确定是否需要拦截，所以创建原生 XHR 对象是必须的。\n\t\t    * open  此时可以取到 URL，可以决定是否进行拦截。\n\t\t    * send  此时已经确定了请求方式。\n\t\n\t\t    规范：\n\t\t    http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/\n\t\t    http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/\n\t\n\t\t    参考实现：\n\t\t

readyState、status、statusText、response、responseText、responseXML 是 readonly，所以，试图通过修改这些状态，来模拟响应是不可行的。\n\t\t        因此，唯一的办法是模拟整个 XMLHttpRequest，就像 jQuery 对事件模型的封装。\n\t\n\t\t    // Event handlers\n\t\t
